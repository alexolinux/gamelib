# gamelib

---------

## WIP

Gamelib is a NodeJS application that aims to manage, organize and customize a game catalog.

The idea for this project came as an initial credit from my friend [Tiago-S-Ribeiro](https://github.com/Tiago-S-Ribeiro) with his Application for managing games. With his idea, we envisioned bringing greater automation and portability, bringing greater dynamism and practicality to game management.
